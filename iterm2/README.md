# iTerm2 config management

iTerm2 doesn't lend itself to easy management of config as code. Too many machine-specific or relatively unimportant settings are exported in the one profile alongside settings that I want to keep the same forever.

Instead of managing files directly in place as a whole, this directory contains useful snippets to use as a reference when reconstructing profiles manually.
